# ${projectName} - ${projectDescription}

This repository contains the `${projectName} micro-decision service`, packaged as a `Quarkus Microservice JAR)`, and was originally generated by the `IBM Decision Manager Open Edition Maven Archetype` in order to ensure compliancee with Maven best practices. 

*This section should describe this project, what it does, how it does it, it’s dependencies, etc…*

## How To Build ${projectName}

Once you have configured your local development environment, you need to perform a `Maven Build` of the repository.  This repository is built using `mvn clean install` by either the CI/CD pipeline or on a local developer workstation.  If deploying artifacts to an enterprise Maven repository, please use `mvn clean deploy`, which requires configuration of the `distributionManagement` section of your project's parent pom.xml.  This project is configured to generate container images and push them to both the registry as well as your cluster, by adding the following properties and profile selection:

```bash
mvn clean install -Denv=container -Pcontainer
```

The `env` property selects %container properties in the `application.properties` file, based on the container prefix.  You can add -D<property>=<value> to each command in order to determine if the image should be published to the registry as well as being deployed to OpenShift, by overriding these defaults:

- quarkus.container-image.build=<default=true>  --> build the image
- quarkus.container-image.push=<default=false>  --> push the image to the registry
- quarkus.openshift.deploy=<default=false>      --> push the image to OCP

Examples: 

```bash 
mvn clean install -Denv=container -Pcontainer -Dquarkus.container-image.push=true
```

This command would create and push the image, but require manual deployment.

## Additional Information (*Appendicies*)
This repository is focused on business automation using [**IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe/9.0.0?topic=introduction-what-is-bamoe) products, specifically the IBM build of [**Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org/) known as **IBM Decison Manager Open Edition**, leveraging [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/) as the assoicated container runtime.  The following online documentation is available in order to learn various aspects of these products and frameworks:

- [**Apache Maven**](https://maven.apache.org/) is a free and open source software project management and comprehension tool. Based on  the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project’s build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of  information. A **getting started guide** is available [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/).

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com//) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. There is a **handbook** available [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), as well as various **guides** for learning and working with Git available [here](https://guides.github.com/)

- [**Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org/) is a cloud-native business automation technology for building cloud-ready business applications. The name Kogito derives from the Latin "Cogito", as in "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"), and is pronounced [ˈkoː.d͡ʒi.to] (KO-jee-to). The letter K refers to Kubernetes, the base for OpenShift as the target cloud platform for Kogito, and to the Knowledge Is Everything (KIE) open source business automation project from which Kogito originates.  Kogito is optimized for a hybrid cloud environment and adapts to your domain and tooling needs. The core objective of Kogito is to help you mold a set of business processes and processs into your own domain-specific cloud-native set of services.  You can find a useful introdution to this technology at [**Getting Started with Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org/get-started/).

- [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/) - Traditional Java stacks were engineered for monolithic applications with long startup times and large memory requirements in a world where the cloud, containers, and Kubernetes did not exist. Java frameworks needed to evolve to meet the needs of this new world.  Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to create applications for a modern, cloud-native world. Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. The goal is to make Java the leading platform in Kubernetes and serverless environments while offering developers a framework to address a wider range of distributed application architectures.
