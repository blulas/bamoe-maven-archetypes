## How To Build ${projectName}

Once you have configured your local development environment, you need to perform a `Maven Build` of the repository.  This repository is built using `mvn clean install` by either the CI/CD pipeline or on a local developer workstation.  If deploying artifacts to an enterprise Maven repository, please use `mvn clean deploy`, which requires configuration of the `distributionManagement` section of your project's parent pom.xml.  

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Additional Information (*Appendicies*)
This repository is focused on business automation using [**IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe/9.0.0?topic=introduction-what-is-bamoe) products, specifically the IBM build of [**Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org/) known as **IBM Decison Manager Open Edition**, leveraging [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/) as the assoicated container runtime.  The following online documentation is available in order to learn various aspects of these products and frameworks:

- [**Apache Maven**](https://maven.apache.org/) is a free and open source software project management and comprehension tool. Based on  the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project’s build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of  information. A **getting started guide** is available [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/).

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com//) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. There is a **handbook** available [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), as well as various **guides** for learning and working with Git available [here](https://guides.github.com/)

- [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/) - Traditional Java stacks were engineered for monolithic applications with long startup times and large memory requirements in a world where the cloud, containers, and Kubernetes did not exist. Java frameworks needed to evolve to meet the needs of this new world.  Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to create applications for a modern, cloud-native world. Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. The goal is to make Java the leading platform in Kubernetes and serverless environments while offering developers a framework to address a wider range of distributed application architectures.  You can find a useful introdution to this technology at [**Getting Started with Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/get-started/).
