# ${projectName} - ${projectDescription}

This repository contains the `${projectName} Fact Model Library`, packaged as a standard Java Archive (JAR)`, and was originally generated by the `IBM Business Automation Manager Open Edition - Fact Model Maven Archetype` in order to ensure compliancee with Maven best practices. 

*This section should describe this project, what it does, how it does it, it’s dependencies, etc…*

## How To Build ${projectName}

This repository is built using `mvn clean install (deploy)` by either the CI/CD pipeline or on a local developer workstation.  Maven `install` places the packaged JAR file into the local Maven `~/.M2/repository`.  Maven `deploy` places the packaged JAR file into the enterprise Maven repository.  This repository relies on application dependencies to be installed into the enterprise Maven repository first.  

## Additional Information (*Appendicies*)
This repository is focused on business automation using [**IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe/9.0.0?topic=introduction-what-is-bamoe) products, specifically the IBM build of [**Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org/) known as **IBM Decison Manager Open Edition**, leveraging [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/) as the assoicated container runtime.  The following online documentation is available in order to learn various aspects of these products and frameworks:

- [**Apache Maven**](https://maven.apache.org/) is a free and open source software project management and comprehension tool. Based on  the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project’s build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of  information. A **getting started guide** is available [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/).

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com//) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. There is a **handbook** available [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), as well as various **guides** for learning and working with Git available [here](https://guides.github.com/)

- [**Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org/) is a cloud-native business automation technology for building cloud-ready business applications. The name Kogito derives from the Latin "Cogito", as in "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"), and is pronounced [ˈkoː.d͡ʒi.to] (KO-jee-to). The letter K refers to Kubernetes, the base for OpenShift as the target cloud platform for Kogito, and to the Knowledge Is Everything (KIE) open source business automation project from which Kogito originates.  Kogito is optimized for a hybrid cloud environment and adapts to your domain and tooling needs. The core objective of Kogito is to help you mold a set of business processes and processs into your own domain-specific cloud-native set of services.  You can find a useful introdution to this technology at [**Getting Started with Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org/get-started/).

- [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/) - Traditional Java stacks were engineered for monolithic applications with long startup times and large memory requirements in a world where the cloud, containers, and Kubernetes did not exist. Java frameworks needed to evolve to meet the needs of this new world.  Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to create applications for a modern, cloud-native world. Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. The goal is to make Java the leading platform in Kubernetes and serverless environments while offering developers a framework to address a wider range of distributed application architectures.
