## How To Build ${projectName}

This repository is built using `mvn clean install (deploy)` by either the CI/CD pipeline or on a local developer workstation.  Maven `install` places the packaged JAR file into the local Maven `~/.M2/repository`.  Maven `deploy` places the packaged JAR file into the enterprise Maven repository.  This repository relies on application dependencies to be installed into the enterprise Maven repository first.
